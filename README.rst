PVI (PV Interface) is a framework for specifying the interface to an EPICS
driver in a single YAML file. The initial target is asyn port driver based
drivers, but it could be extended to streamDevice and other driver types at a
later date.

It allows the asyn parameter interface to be specified in a single place,
and removes boilerplate code in the driver CPP, template files, documentation,
and low level opis.
